# amethyst-boids

This is a project whose purpose is to be an introductory guide to both problem solving in Entity Component Systems *and* to the Amethyst game engine (version 0.11). I'll also be talking about some of the less intuitive things I encountered during this project to hopefully help others who have had issues adopting the framework.

- Gltf loading
    - amethyst won't add a material if you don't add one to the gltf file
- Rendering gltf & PBR
    - the systems and bundles necessary to getting a GLTF to load/render
